Bazille would have known that an eclogue was an idyllic poem in the form of a conversation between rustics in an Arcadian landscape. In its radiance and quiescence, this composition, although lacking figures, certainly conforms to the tradition of bucolic landscapes.','https://collections.artsmia.org/art/1728/landscape-by-the-lez-river-jean-frederic-bazille','US','Minneapolis Institute of Art','Minneapolis Institute of Art','On View');

It shows one of the artist''s sisters, Edma, watching over her sleeping daughter, Blanche. It is the first image of motherhood—later one of her favourite subjects—to appear in Morisot''s work.

The mother''s gaze, her bent left arm, a mirror image of the child''s arm, and the baby''s closed eyes form a diagonal line which is further accentuated by the movement of the curtain in the background. This diagonal links the mother to her child. Edma''s gesture, drawing the net curtain of the cradle between the spectator and the baby, further reinforces the feeling of intimacy and protective love expressed in the painting.

Berthe Morisot showed The Cradle at the Impressionist exhibition of 1874—the first woman to exhibit with the group. The painting was scarcely noticed although important critics commented on its grace and elegance. After unsuccessful attempts to sell it, Berthe Morisot withdrew it from display and The Cradle stayed in the model''s family until it was bought by the Louvre in 1930.','https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?nnumid=1132','France','Musée d''Orsay','Musée d''Orsay','On View');

It represents the bustling interior of one of the most prominent music halls and cabarets of Paris, the Folies-Bergère. The venue opened in 1869 and its atmosphere was described as “unmixed joy”. In contrast, the barmaid in Manet’s representation is detached and marooned behind the bar.

The Folies-Bergère was also notorious as a place to pick up prostitutes. The writer Guy de Maupassant described the barmaids as “vendors of drink and of love”.

Manet knew the place well. He made a number of preparatory sketches there but the final work was painted in his studio. He set up a bar and asked one of the barmaids, Suzon, to serve as his model.

The painting was first exhibited in 1882, at the annual fine arts exhibition in Paris, the Salon. Visitors and critics found the composition unsettling.

He produced another extensive series in the 1880s and exhibited seven of the works at the eighth and final Impressionist exhibition in 1886. The series, entitled "Suite of female nudes, bathing, washing, drying themselves, wiping themselves, combing their hair or having their hair combed", inspired harsh criticism and fuelled the controversy on the artist''s misogyny.

Captured in the privacy of their bedroom, as if unbeknownst to them, the women go about their bathing. The artist shows them crouching in their tub (a large, flat basin), rinsing, standing, drying themselves on a chair or armchair... The unaffected gestures are highlighted by views from above and truncated frames replicated by the artist drawing after drawing.

In our pastel, the young woman in three-quarter profile, her face bent forward hidden by her raised right arm, is drying the nape of her neck with a towel. She is sitting on a settee, the back of which is upholstered with mauve and ultramarine fabric, in front of a bathtub that can be made out in the background to the left. The rather tight frame accentuates the young woman''s outstretched body, her left arm thrown behind her, almost in line with the right arm raised in front.

The drawing is immediately intriguing by its complexity. Two aspects especially draw the most attention: the long fold of paper in the upper right, like a scar that divides two sections treated in very different manners; and the work of the pastel itself, powdery on rough paper at one end, smooth and polished at the extreme of the other.

It would seem that Degas worked in two stages, first concentrating on the woman''s body, then reworking his drawing to complete certain sections at the top of the sheet and defining the contours with hatching. The different treatments suggest that the drawing was reworked after several years and, by stylistic comparison, likely between 1880 and 1890.

Degas experiments here with all of the resources pastel has to offer: powdery and adhering unevenly to the coarse-grained paper, applied in successive layers, dampened to obtain a homogenous paste delicately worked to recreate the plasticity, fullness and softness of the female skin tone. Although the fold most likely occurred when the pastel was dampened, Degas did not try to conceal it; on the contrary, he accepted the accident for the possibilities it provided him and used it as a source of innovation.

Complex by its execution, intriguing by the questions it raises on the stages of its creation, After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself is above all an extremely sensual work, in which the woman''s body is almost demanding to be caressed.','http://www.muma-lehavre.com/en/collections/artworks-in-context/impressionism/degas-after-bath-woman-drying-herself','France','Musée d’art moderne André Malraux - MuMa','Musée d’art moderne André Malraux - MuMa','On View');

Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884, painted less than a decade later.','https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20684/paris-street-rainy-day','US','Art Institute of Chicago','Art Institute of Chicago','On View');

The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting.

The painting is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement.

Impression, Sunrise depicts the port of Le Havre, Monet''s hometown. It is now displayed at the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris.

Impression, Sunrise depicts the port of Le Havre at sunrise, the two small rowboats in the foreground and the red Sun being the focal elements. In the middle ground, more fishing boats are included, while in the background on the left side of the painting are clipper ships with tall masts. Behind them are other misty shapes that "are not trees but smoke stacks of packboats and steamships, while on the right in the distance are other masts and chimneys silhouetted against the sky." In order to show these features of industry, Monet eliminated existing houses on the left side of the jetty, leaving the background unobscured.

Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the regeneration of France was exemplified in the thriving port of Le Havre.Art historian Paul Tucker suggests that the contrast of elements like the steamboats and cranes in the background to the fishermen in the foreground represent these political implications: "Monet may have seen this painting of a highly commercial site as an answer to the postwar calls for patriotic action and an art that could lead. For while it is a poem of light and atmosphere, the painting can also be seen as an ode to the power and beauty of a revitalized France."

The representation of Le Havre, hometown of Monet and a center of industry and commerce, celebrates the "renewed strength and beauty of the country... Monet’s ultimate utopian statement." Art demonstrating France’s revitalization, Monet’s depiction of Le Havre’s sunrise mirrors the renewal of France.','https://www.marmottan.fr/notice/4014/','France','Musée Marmottan Monet','Musée Marmottan Monet','On View');

Yet in Le déjeuner sur l''herbe, Manet was paying tribute to Europe''s artistic heritage, borrowing his subject from the Concert champêtre – a painting by Titian attributed at the time to Giorgione (Louvre) – and taking his inspiration for the composition of the central group from the Marcantonio Raimondi engraving after Raphael''s Judgement of Paris.But the classical references were counterbalanced by Manet''s boldness. The presence of a nude woman among clothed men is justified neither by mythological nor allegorical precedents. This, and the contemporary dress, rendered the strange and almost unreal scene obscene in the eyes of the public of the day. Manet himself jokingly nicknamed his painting "la partie carrée".

In those days, Manet''s style and treatment were considered as shocking as the subject itself. He made no transition between the light and dark elements of the picture, abandoning the usual subtle gradations in favour of brutal contrasts, thereby drawing reproaches for his "mania for seeing in blocks". And the characters seem to fit uncomfortably in the sketchy background of woods from which Manet has deliberately excluded both depth and perspective. Le déjeuner sur l''herbe - testimony to Manet''s refusal to conform to convention and his initiation of a new freedom from traditional subjects and modes of representation - can perhaps be considered as the departure point for Modern Art.','https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-7123.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&cHash=512f19b12b','France','Musée d''Orsay','Musée d''Orsay','On View');

Three of them are featured in interiors which are all indirect self-portraits depicting the new life as an artist which he relished.
Bazille, who received an allowance from his parents, was generous to his friends and shared several of his apartments with them.

In 1864, Bazille and Monet moved into the rue de Furstenberg together; in 1867, he shared lodgings in the rue Visconti with Renoir – and occasionally Monet and Sisley.
In the studio, the artists, and friends who were passing through, worked with professional female models or posed for each other when funds were short.

In early 1868, Frédéric Bazille moved into a more spacious studio with Renoir in the rapidly developing Les Batignolles district, not far from the Café Guerbois – haunt of the realist avant-garde including Fantin-Latour, Degas, Manet, and also the writers Zola, Astruc and Duranty.

Bazille painted a view of his own studio featuring his friends, echoing A Studio at Les Batignolles by Fantin-Latour (Paris, Musée d’Orsay). Bazille, who was painted in the centre of the picture by Manet, was now an integral part of the circle of “actualistes”, as they were dubbed by Zola.

There are the most amusing things everywhere: hundreds of windmills and enchanting boats, extremely friendly Dutchmen…" Using a limited palette of varying shades of green, Monet has captured the hazy atmosphere and light-dappled water of this picturesque Dutch port.

In the early years of impressionism, Monet, Renoir, and others strove to capture the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere on the landscape and to transcribe directly and quickly their sensory experience of it. Monet advised the American artist Lilla Cabot Perry, "When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have before you, a tree, a house, a field or whatever.

In 1841, zinc paint tubes appeared for the first time, making painting in the open air a lot simpler. The paint no longer dried out so quickly and was easier to carry. The impressionists took full advantage of this. They left their studios and went painting outdoors, ‘en plein air’.

From on the water
From 1871 to 1878, Claude Monet lived in Argenteuil, a village on the Seine just outside Paris. Following the example of the painter Charles-François Daubigny, he had a boat built in which he could paint the surroundings from on the water. Thus he was able to depict the effects of light on the water and on the landscape from any convenient spot.

Impression
In this painting the boat is moored between two poles, motionless on the water. A figure is vaguely distinguishable in the cabin, probably Monet himself. The majority of the canvas is occupied by the clam flowing river, in which the boat studio and the trees, but also the sky are reflected. In this painting, Claude Monet gives an impression of the tranquillity on the water during a summer day.','https://krollermuller.nl/en/claude-monet-monet-s-studio-boat','Netherlands','Kröller-Müller Museum','Kröller-Müller Museum','On View');

The Impressionist painting depicts a steam train from Normandy arriving at the Gare Saint-Lazare railway station in Paris, with crowds of people waiting amid the steam and smoke under the vaulted iron and glass vault of the station''s train shed. It was painted en plein air, at the station. It measures 60.3 cm × 80.2 cm (23.7 in × 31.6 in) and is signed and dated in the lower left corner, "Claude Monet 77".

The painting is one of 12 works by Monet depicting a scene at the station, and it was also one of eight that he exhibited at the Third Impressionist Exhibition [fr] in Paris in April 1877. It was sold to Ernest Hoschedé in March 1877, but was in the possession of Georges de Bellio [de; fr; nl] the following year. On his death in 1894, it was inherited by de Bellio''s daughter Victorine and her husband Ernest Donop de Monchy. Sold to the Bernheim-Jeune gallery around 1899, it passed through the hands of the art dealer Paul Rosenberg and then the Durand-Ruel gallery in Paris in 1911, which took the painting to New York. It was sold later in 1911 to the wealthy businessman and art collector Martin A. Ryerson for US$7,000. On his death in 1932, it was bequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago.','https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16571/arrival-of-the-normandy-train-gare-saint-lazare','US','Art Institute of Chicago','Art Institute of Chicago','On View');

A favourite subject indeed in Monet’s paintings during his stay at Vétheuil. Deep with astutely defined colour contrast across the canvas, Claude Monet’s Vetheuil in the Fog, enthrals a spectacular production into a foggy morning on the water. Monet makes use of a blue tonation throughout the painting further amplifying and reflecting the blue of the water and the sky, more to the meaning, giving impression and shrewdness; that with the dawn of the fog all things blend into one. Claude Monet’s Vetheuil in the Fog indeed is an excellent astute touch exceptionally offering subtle, albeit shrewd distinct impressions of figural forms throughout the artwork, an excellent example of Monet’s exquisite impressionist style intricately perfected over the years, as was evidently characteristic in many of his paintings. Vetheuil in the Fog depicts a grand splendour. Across the canvas, it is observable that Claude Monet prudently applied his brush in hastened technique as the outlines indicate attempts to encapture the beauty of the moment, the exact image, carefully blending all the aspects before the gleaming beams of the sunlight spread shifted or faded away altogether. Claude Monet’s emphasis on capturing the fleeting changes in the beautiful natural world was an all too central aspect of his aptitude. Capturing the ephemerality of nature and preserving these transient and stunning moments within a picture plane, crystallising this momentary perception, optical nourishment for the soul forever. A glance afar the astral plane, a view beyond compare. Claude Monet 1840 to 1926, founder of the impressionism style of painting, was one of the most influential and monumental landscape painter in Art History. Born in Paris, Monet was subsequently enrolled in the studio of Glenyre, where he met the likes of Sisley, Renoir, and Bazille, who later on became core founders of the Impressionist group. In 1878, Claude moved with his family to Vetheuil, a town in Northern France. During his stay, they temporarily lived with an affluent magnate who later on became Monet’s patron. But it was during this time, and his stay at Vetheuil that he made one of his most excellent works, ‘Vetheuil in the Fog’ a masterpiece illuminated by carefully placed short strokes of colour in favour creating a contrast effect making the painting more vivid, relishing, and breath-taking to the eye. Embracing Alfresco painting, Monet broke the outgoing tradition of portraying a subject by literally resonating the canvas conveying the transient details from fleeting effects of atmosphere to the time of day in depicting the moment, not forgetting a touch of pizzazz in illuminating colour and light. Carefully eliminating black and grey spread from his palette, representing colour in valour like a prism, breaking it down into its spatial units, often painting a series of the same scenery under different ambiences from light, to weather conditions, amongst other aspects. Claude Monet indeed successfully brought the ambient study of transient effects of natural light, with respect to the totality of the surrounding, and how they blend into one, to its most refined expression and proportions, ultimately rising to become a forerunner of 20th-century impressionist revolution and embracement of modernism.','http://www.monetpaintings.org/vetheuil-in-the-fog/','France','Musée Marmottan Monet','Musée Marmottan Monet','On View');

One of his earlier paintings gave the movement its name when the art critic, Louis LeRoi, referred to Impression: Sunrise, 1872, as not a painting, but an impression. Monet painted out-of-doors on an unprimed canvas. He depicted a subject as the eye perceives it in a given moment in time, not as clarified by the artist. His use of short brushstrokes and a rich impasto (heavy laying-on of paint) give this work a textural quality. The artist achieved a shimmering effect by placing contrasting colors next to each other like red and green, each intensifying the other. Notice the lack of a horizon line. Monet was revising the way a landscape should appear. In 1883, Monet moved forty miles from Paris, to Giverny, where he would live for the next forty years. He developed a large flower garden in front of his house and excavated the famous pond that would be the source of his water lily paintings. This painting is one of a small series done late in the artist''s life at Giverny. He had done several series showing the same subject matter at different times of day, moving his easel with the changing light and weather conditions.

In 1893, Monet purchased an adjacent tract, which included a small brook, and transformed the site into an Asian-inspired oasis of cool greens, exotic plants, and calm waters, enhanced by a Japanese footbridge. The serial approach embodied in this work—one of about a dozen paintings in which Monet returned to the same view under differing weather and light conditions—was one of his great formal innovations. He was committed to painting directly from nature as frequently as possible and whenever weather permitted, sometimes working on eight or more canvases in the same day.

The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees.

Er gab Monet Motive für zahlreiche Bilder, so auch für das Münchner Gemälde. In seinen zahlreichen "Nymphéas" greift der alte Maler kompositionell und koloristisch auf den Japonismus zurück, der bei der Entstehung des französischen Impressionismus bereits entscheidend Pate gestanden hatte. Form und Raum werden als Fläche interpretiert, aber diese Fläche ist nicht nur transparent, sondern reflektiert in Gestalt der Wasserspiegelung zugleich Formen, die außerhalb des Bildausschnitts liegen, sodass sie eine unbestimmte Mehrdimensionalität annimmt.

Due to the war, Monet’s luxurious compound at Giverny was for the most part emptied of his children’s families and his household staff, who were either called into service or moved away from the advancing German army. His only surviving son was in constant danger at the front. At times Monet could hear artillery fire, but he refused to leave, preferring to share the fate of his gardens.

As a group, the Weeping Willow paintings are characterized by shadowy colors and writhing forms, as if Monet intended to express the grieving mood not simply with the subject, but also through an expressionist style of painting. They were among the very few easel-scale paintings that Monet made after 1914, when he claimed his failing eyesight was best suited for working in larger formats. The particular tree portrayed in Weeping Willow had pride of place on the bank of Monet’s water garden, with its exotic water lilies. The tree’s trunk, its cascading branches, and its reflection are all incorporated into his greatest artistic legacy, the mural-scale Nymphéas canvases that were his preoccupation from 1914 until his death.','https://www.kimbellart.org/collection/ap-199602','US','Kimbell Art Museum','Kimbell Art Museum','On View');

The principal subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266-1290) which Monet began near the end of the summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.

The series is famous for the way in which Monet repeated the same subject to show the differing light and atmosphere at different times of day, across the seasons and in many types of weather.

The series is among Monet''s most notable work. The largest Haystacks collections are held at the Musée d''Orsay and Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, and in the Art Institute of Chicago. Other collections include the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo,  and Paris'' Musée de l''Orangerie. The Art Institute of Chicago collection includes six of the twenty-five Haystacks.

Other museums that hold parts of this series include the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut (which also has one of five from the earlier 1888-89 harvest), the Scottish National Gallery, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Kunsthaus Zürich, and the Shelburne Museum, Vermont.

In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art.

They are now housed in two oval rooms in the Musėe de l’Orangerie in Paris. The rest of the large-scale water-lily canvases, of which this is one, remained in Giverny until after the Second World War.

The Orangerie canvases tend to have recognisable details of trees and foliage which act as compositional anchors and help locate the viewer in the scene. However, this painting lacks any of these; distance and perspective are abolished and a limitless expanse of water occupies our entire field of vision. The huge pale picture offers an immersive experience, its surface alive and shimmering with trails of green, ochre, violet, yellow, sky blue and pink.','https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/claude-monet-water-lilies','UK','The National Gallery','The National Gallery','On View');
