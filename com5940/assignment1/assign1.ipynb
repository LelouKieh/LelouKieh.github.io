It represents the bustling interior of one of the most prominent music halls and cabarets of Paris, the Folies-Bergère. The venue opened in 1869 and its atmosphere was described as “unmixed joy”. In contrast, the barmaid in Manet’s representation is detached and marooned behind the bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Folies-Bergère was also notorious as a place to pick up prostitutes. The writer Guy de Maupassant described the barmaids as “vendors of drink and of love”.\\r\\n\\r\\nManet knew the place well. He made a number of preparatory sketches there but the final work was painted in his studio. He set up a bar and asked one of the barmaids, Suzon, to serve as his model.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe painting was first exhibited in 1882, at the annual fine arts exhibition in Paris, the Salon. Visitors and critics found the composition unsettling. The inaccuracy of the barmaid’s reflection, shifted too far to the right, has continued to spark much debate.', 'more_info': 'https://courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/collection/impressionism-post-impressionism/edouard-manet-a-bar-at-the-folies-bergere', 'in_which_country': 'UK', 'museum': 'Courtauld Institute of Art', 'museum_name': 'Courtauld Institute of Art', 'status': 'Not On View'}, {'painting_name': 'After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself', 'author': 'Edgar Degas', 'artist': 'Edgar Degas', 'year': 1884, 'photo': 'Edgar_Degas_-_After_the_bath%2C_woman_drying_herself_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fc70db75c18cf371477c01d574eb9ce6/d4e081d1/Edgar_Degas_-_After_the_bath2C_woman_drying_herself_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)', 'synopsis': 'Degas executed his first pastels of women washing themselves around 1876–1877. He produced another extensive series in the 1880s and exhibited seven of the works at the eighth and final Impressionist exhibition in 1886. The series, entitled \"Suite of female nudes, bathing, washing, drying themselves, wiping themselves, combing their hair or having their hair combed\", inspired harsh criticism and fuelled the controversy on the artist\\'s misogyny.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptured in the privacy of their bedroom, as if unbeknownst to them, the women go about their bathing. The artist shows them crouching in their tub (a large, flat basin), rinsing, standing, drying themselves on a chair or armchair... The unaffected gestures are highlighted by views from above and truncated frames replicated by the artist drawing after drawing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our pastel, the young woman in three-quarter profile, her face bent forward hidden by her raised right arm, is drying the nape of her neck with a towel. She is sitting on a settee, the back of which is upholstered with mauve and ultramarine fabric, in front of a bathtub that can be made out in the background to the left. The rather tight frame accentuates the young woman\\'s outstretched body, her left arm thrown behind her, almost in line with the right arm raised in front.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drawing is immediately intriguing by its complexity. Two aspects especially draw the most attention: the long fold of paper in the upper right, like a scar that divides two sections treated in very different manners; and the work of the pastel itself, powdery on rough paper at one end, smooth and polished at the extreme of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would seem that Degas worked in two stages, first concentrating on the woman\\'s body, then reworking his drawing to complete certain sections at the top of the sheet and defining the contours with hatching. The different treatments suggest that the drawing was reworked after several years and, by stylistic comparison, likely between 1880 and 1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nDegas experiments here with all of the resources pastel has to offer: powdery and adhering unevenly to the coarse-grained paper, applied in successive layers, dampened to obtain a homogenous paste delicately worked to recreate the plasticity, fullness and softness of the female skin tone. Although the fold most likely occurred when the pastel was dampened, Degas did not try to conceal it; on the contrary, he accepted the accident for the possibilities it provided him and used it as a source of innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplex by its execution, intriguing by the questions it raises on the stages of its creation, After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself is above all an extremely sensual work, in which the woman\\'s body is almost demanding to be caressed.', 'more_info': 'http://www.muma-lehavre.com/en/collections/artworks-in-context/impressionism/degas-after-bath-woman-drying-herself', 'in_which_country': 'France', 'museum': 'Musée d’art moderne André Malraux - MuMa', 'museum_name': 'Musée d’art moderne André Malraux - MuMa', 'status': 'On View'}, {'painting_name': 'Agapanthus', 'author': 'Claude Monet', 'artist': 'Claude Monet', 'year': 1914, 'photo': '1914-26_Claude_Monet_Agapanthus_MOMA_NY_anagoria.JPG (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c6a1043c6175be62c639f436a0032ed/28b50780/1914-26_Claude_Monet_Agapanthus_MOMA_NY_anagoria.JPG)', 'synopsis': 'Monet frequently painted outdoors, drawing endless inspiration from the plants, trees, and pond at Giverny.

One of his earlier paintings gave the movement its name when the art critic, Louis LeRoi, referred to Impression: Sunrise, 1872, as not a painting, but an impression.

His use of short brushstrokes and a rich impasto (heavy laying-on of paint) give this work a textural quality. The artist achieved a shimmering effect by placing contrasting colors next to each other like red and green, each intensifying the other. Notice the lack of a horizon line. Monet was revising the way a landscape should appear. In 1883, Monet moved forty miles from Paris, to Giverny, where he would live for the next forty years. He developed a large flower garden in front of his house and excavated the famous pond that would be the source of his water lily paintings. This painting is one of a small series done late in the artist's life at Giverny.

Grain stacks, for example, are traditional symbols of the land's fertility, the local farmers' material wealth, and the region's prosperity.\", 'more_info': 'https://collections.mfa.org/objects/32189/grainstack-sunset?ctx=ecf59bbe-e1f4-4cc2-9195-053ba280a66a&idx=36', 'in_which_country': 'US', 'museum': 'Museum of the Fine Arts Boston', 'museum_name': 'Museum of the Fine Arts Boston', 'status': 'On View'}, {'painting_name': 'Hay Harvest at Éragny', 'author': 'Camille Pissarro', 'artist': 'Camille Pissarro', 'year': 1901, 'photo': 'imageserver (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/77a9de451f17de78ada7bf41391f93ec/f04c7e82/imageserver)', 'synopsis': 'Hay Harvest at Éragny (French: Fenaison à Éragny) is a 1901 painting by French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro depicting the hay harvest in the French commune of Éragny-sur-Epte.', 'more_info': 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hay_Harvest_at_%C3%89ragny,_1901,_Camille_Pissarro.jpg', 'in_which_country': 'Canada', 'museum': 'National Gallery of Canada', 'museum_name': 'National Gallery of Canada', 'status': 'On View'}, {'painting_name': 'Houses on the Achterzaan', 'author': 'Claude Monet', 'artist': 'Claude Monet', 'year': 1871, 'photo': '1600px-Houses_on_the_Achterzaan_MET_DT719.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/75e0a6169a15e7639bf9d9abee1762d7/d7791a04/1600px-Houses_on_the_Achterzaan_MET_DT719.jpg)', 'synopsis': 'On the advice of the French painter Charles-François Daubigny, Claude Monet traveled to the Netherlands in 1871, where he painted this landscape of limpid waters and azure skies along the Achterzaan River in Zaandam.

The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting.

Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884, painted less than a decade later.', 'more_info': 'https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20684/paris-street-rainy-day', 'in_which_country': 'US', 'museum': 'Art Institute of Chicago', 'museum_name': 'Art Institute of Chicago', 'status': 'On View'}, {'painting_name': 'Paysage au bord du Lez', 'author': 'Frédéric Bazille', 'artist': 'Frédéric Bazille', 'year': 1870, 'photo': 'Paysage au bord du Lez.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/95c40dd411a286aa97bac4b3387c2f15/2532309f/1728.jpg)', 'synopsis': 'In June 1870, Bazille informed his father “I have just about finished a large landscape (eclogue).” Two weeks later he enlisted in the French army to serve during the Franco–Prussian War and died in combat near Orléans in November.

A favourite subject indeed in Monet’s paintings during his stay at Vétheuil. Deep with astutely defined colour contrast across the canvas, Claude Monet’s Vetheuil in the Fog, enthrals a spectacular production into a foggy morning on the water. Monet makes use of a blue tonation throughout the painting further amplifying and reflecting the blue of the water and the sky, more to the meaning, giving impression and shrewdness; that with the dawn of the fog all things blend into one. Claude Monet’s Vetheuil in the Fog indeed is an excellent astute touch exceptionally offering subtle, albeit shrewd distinct impressions of figural forms throughout the artwork, an excellent example of Monet’s exquisite impressionist style intricately perfected over the years, as was evidently characteristic in many of his paintings. Vetheuil in the Fog depicts a grand splendour. Across the canvas, it is observable that Claude Monet prudently applied his brush in hastened technique as the outlines indicate attempts to encapture the beauty of the moment, the exact image, carefully blending all the aspects before the gleaming beams of the sunlight spread shifted or faded away altogether. Claude Monet’s emphasis on capturing the fleeting changes in the beautiful natural world was an all too central aspect of his aptitude. Capturing the ephemerality of nature and preserving these transient and stunning moments within a picture plane, crystallising this momentary perception, optical nourishment for the soul forever. A glance afar the astral plane, a view beyond compare. Claude Monet 1840 to 1926, founder of the impressionism style of painting, was one of the most influential and monumental landscape painter in Art History. Born in Paris, Monet was subsequently enrolled in the studio of Glenyre, where he met the likes of Sisley, Renoir, and Bazille, who later on became core founders of the Impressionist group. In 1878, Claude moved with his family to Vetheuil, a town in Northern France. During his stay, they temporarily lived with an affluent magnate who later on became Monet’s patron. But it was during this time, and his stay at Vetheuil that he made one of his most excellent works, ‘Vetheuil in the Fog’ a masterpiece illuminated by carefully placed short strokes of colour in favour creating a contrast effect making the painting more vivid, relishing, and breath-taking to the eye. Embracing Alfresco painting, Monet broke the outgoing tradition of portraying a subject by literally resonating the canvas conveying the transient details from fleeting effects of atmosphere to the time of day in depicting the moment, not forgetting a touch of pizzazz in illuminating colour and light. Carefully eliminating black and grey spread from his palette, representing colour in valour like a prism, breaking it down into its spatial units, often painting a series of the same scenery under different ambiences from light, to weather conditions, amongst other aspects. Claude Monet indeed successfully brought the ambient study of transient effects of natural light, with respect to the totality of the surrounding, and how they blend into one, to its most refined expression and proportions, ultimately rising to become a forerunner of 20th-century impressionist revolution and embracement of modernism.', 'more_info': 'http://www.monetpaintings.org/vetheuil-in-the-fog/', 'in_which_country': 'France', 'museum': 'Musée Marmottan Monet', 'museum_name': 'Musée Marmottan Monet', 'status': 'On View'}, {'painting_name': 'View at Rouelles, Le Havre', 'author': 'Claude Monet', 'artist': 'Claude Monet', 'year': 1858, 'photo': 'Monet%2C_Claude_-_View_At_Rouelles%2C_Le_Havre_%281858%29.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fe7e33f3b958c840ab8205dbdbfd12e1/d3f33672/Monet2C_Claude_-_View_At_Rouelles2C_Le_Havre_28185829.jpg)', 'synopsis': '46 x 65 cm; Private collection; an early work showing the influence of Corot and Courbet', 'more_info': 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monet,_Claude_-_View_At_Rouelles,_Le_Havre_(1858).jpg', 'in_which_country': 'Unknown', 'museum': 'Private', 'museum_name': 'N/A', 'status': 'Lost'}, {'painting_name': 'View of the Saint-Martin Canal', 'author': 'Alfred Sisley', 'artist': 'Alfred Sisley', 'year': 1870, 'photo': 'Alfred_Sisley_001.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/481dc5ead6a0d42b151efdb0a3839c4b/28b3e6be/Alfred_Sisley_001.jpg)', 'synopsis': \"View of the Canal Saint-Martin is an 1870 painting by Alfred Sisley, first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1870.

The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether.
